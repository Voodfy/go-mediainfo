go-mediainfo
============

Go wrapper of the mediainfo library.

`cmd/howtouse/howtouse.go` shows a brief example of most of the functions. The MediaInfo library is a bit unconventional
in its design and somewhat poorly documented.
Unlike the official wrappers there are a few liberties with naming taken to make the library more idiomatic Go.

TODO
====

Implement internal handling of DLL loading and support Windows by using ANSI versions always.
